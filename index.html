            <p>
                As you may have guessed, my name is Hamza Khan. I am a computer science student interested in technology. My degree may say B.S. in Computer Science, but I love anything and everything to do with technology from the basic Arduino, to the mind blowing Oculus Rift. 
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-center">My <span class="red">Drive</span></h1>
            <p>
                I enjoy learning about new innovations and ideas, but more than that, I enjoy working with others who share my passion. One of my favorite pastimes is going to Hackathons where i can group up with random people, start with a simple idea, and create something in 24 hours. That's the best part about being a programmer. Being able to create an image in my mind, and then sitting down for hours on end, never losing focus, and drumming out a quality program. That is my <span class="red">drive</span>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="catch text-center">Ready. <span class="red">Set. </span>CODE!</h2>

            <h1 class="text-center">Rift <span class="project">Rampage</span></h1>
            <p class="white">
                My first venture into the vast world of Virtual Reality gaming. It was made at CodeRed, Houston's Premier Hackathon. 
                Made in <span class="white"><a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity</a></span>, Rift Rampage is a multiplayer first person shooter incorporating the <span class="white"><a href="http://www.oculus.com">Oculus Rift</a></span> Virtual Reality headset and the <span class="white"><a href="http://www.leapmotion.com">LeapMotion</a></span> Hand Controller. 
<br><br>
                The basic idea was that two players would face each other in a 3D virtual environment, where they would shoot at each other aiming to defeat the other. The players would hold out their hands over the LeapMotion device, and it would display their virtual hands on the screen. The player makes a tapping gesture with his thumb, and a bullet would shoot from his index finger.

                    <p>Hackathons have taken the world by storm, and they're not about breaking or stealing. They're about solving problems, building ideas, and pushing the limits of the mind and body to create something amazing. </p>
